## üß™ Testing

Open `test.html` in your browser to test the extension with various input types:
- Regular text inputs
- Textareas
- Contenteditable elements
- Static page content

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Manifest V3**: Modern Chrome extension architecture
- **Content Script**: Runs on every webpage to process text
- **Popup Interface**: User controls and settings
- **Background Service Worker**: Handles messaging and storage
- **MutationObserver**: Watches for dynamic DOM changes

### Permissions
- `activeTab`: Access to current tab
- `storage`: Save user preferences and statistics
- `scripting`: Programmatic script injection (if needed)

### Storage
- Uses `chrome.storage.local` for persistent settings
- Stores mode preference, insult count, and custom dictionary
- Data persists across browser sessions

## üé® Customization

### CSS Styling
The extension uses aggressive, mean styling with:
- Loud red/orange color scheme
- Bold, aggressive fonts
- Dark theme with high contrast
- Animated elements and hover effects

### Adding New Words
1. Open the popup and edit the dictionary
2. Follow the JSON format: `"original": "replacement"`
3. Save and test immediately
4. Words are case-insensitive but preserve original casing

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?
1. **Check permissions**: Ensure the extension has access to the current site
2. **Reload the page**: Sometimes a page refresh is needed
3. **Check console**: Open DevTools and look for Errorly messages
4. **Verify mode**: Make sure you've selected LIVE or ENTER mode

### Words Not Replacing?
1. **Check spelling**: Ensure exact word matches in the dictionary
2. **Verify mode**: LIVE mode replaces as you type, ENTER mode on Enter key
3. **Field type**: Works on text inputs, textareas, and contenteditable elements
4. **Page refresh**: Some sites may need a refresh after activation

### Performance Issues?
1. **Large pages**: Very long pages may take a moment to process
2. **Many replacements**: Extensive dictionaries may slow down typing
3. **Dynamic content**: Heavy AJAX sites may cause delays
